We are looking at data on hate crimes across the United States from February to August 2017 based on articles published about this crime. You can access our dataset  [here](https://www.kaggle.com/team-ai/classification-of-hate-crime-in-the-us). The dataset contains 3700 observations of the following features: Article Date, Article Title, Orgaization, City, State, URL, Keywords, Summary. The questions we are answering using the dataset are the following:

1. Where do the most hate crimes occur (or rather, where are most hate crimes reported)?
2. Are there certain time periods (months) during which hate crime reports seem to occur more/less frequently?
3. What demographic group seems to be most frequently targetted in hate crimes according to this dataset?

The data is contained in a static .csv file downloaded from Kaggle, and we combined it with a dataset of information on cities acrosss the United States to be able to map it. Using the data, we created interactive visualizations in a shiny app to answer each of the above questions, located [here]().
